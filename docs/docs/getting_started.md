# Getting Started

This page will walk you through all the steps to get the cancellation task up and running on your
 own machine.
We will first walk you through how to install the cancellation task software and analysis
 pipeline, and then we will walk you through each component of the software so you know the
 ins and outs of how things work.
The program is designed to work without any need to change the code, however if you spot an
issue please do report it on the github page.

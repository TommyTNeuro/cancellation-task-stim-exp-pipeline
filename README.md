## Aim of project

The broad aim of the project is to provide a full computerised cancellation task,
with a comprehensive and automated analysis.

The project will be user friendly even for non-technical users as well as being,
high-performance and accurate. 

## Evidence

I created this task during my dissertation to measure pseudoneglect, after
measuring 17 participants in test conditions a significant leftward bias
was found.

Note: I will upload this paper indicating these results in more detail in the
future. I will also carry out a more widespread test with at least 50
participants to verify this effect. Thank you for you patience.

## Psychtoolbox version

The matlab version of this project was built with psychtoolbox version: 3.0.19.15 

Note: The matlab version of this project will be later replaced as the main version,
for the experimental software. However the matlab version will still be avaliable,
but only updated with critial bug fixes.

## Future plans

 - Python version of experiment program.
 - State of the art spatial attentional analysis.
 - Extensive documentation on how to use program.
 - Eye-Tracking support.
 - Neuroimaging support (OPM-MEG/SQUID MEG, EEG).
 - Support for real-time feedback.
 - Support for additional languages.
 - High-Performance Rust Core.

 ## Citation

 When using this task or pipeline please cite the github
 repo until the paper is made avaliable. A paper will be
 avaliable soon.
